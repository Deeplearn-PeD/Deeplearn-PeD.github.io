In this new Year, DeepLearn starts as a new external face to a team os experienced researchers with many years of experience of bringing AI to verticals typically ignored by big AI corporations.
Along with the usual challenges related to simple survival, we are driven to find and develop new AI solutions than can solve problems instead of creating them (like the Fake news industry). In this road we hope to continue to meet inspiring people that can help us identify the worthy problems and the talented ones that will partner with us to build the solutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
