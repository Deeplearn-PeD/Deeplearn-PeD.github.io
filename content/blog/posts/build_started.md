Our journey has just begun in Backdrop Build v4! Israel and I are super excited and we are looking forward to having a first release very soon. Today I have managed to prepared the demos database that we are going to use for the first release. It has 20 years worth of dengue incidence data for Reggie to chew on!

Another exciting milestone is that we'll have the first usable interface for our product out for testing by the end of the week. We are looking forward to getting feedback from our users and making improvements based on their suggestions. 

We are looking forward to the challenges of deploying an AI agent in the real world. We've got some credits from [Runpod](https://runpod.io) and we hope that their platform will help us with ou GPU needs.

I'll be posting updates on our progress here, so stay tuned!
