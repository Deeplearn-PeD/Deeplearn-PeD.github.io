In our previous post we mentioned that we were joining the [Backdrop Build](https://backdropbuild.com) program this year where we are proposing to turn our [REG](/team/reg.md) AI into a product. Even with our best efforts we felt that the Reggie D. Bot was not ready to be a product yet. So we rejoined [Backdrop Build v5](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v5/reggie-d-bot-yq9d) to continue our work on Reggie D. Bot, while benefitting of building withing the backdrop community.

We are now pleased to announce that we are confident to launch the Beta version of Reggie D. Bot. when the launch date for v5 comes.

In fact, Today we made the [first release](https://github.com/Deeplearn-PeD/reggui/releases/tag/v0.3.2) of Reg D. Bot, for both desktop and Web, though we stil haven't made a public deploy on the web. Stay tuned as this will probably happen before the end of this month.
