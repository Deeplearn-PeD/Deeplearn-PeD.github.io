Deeplearn is joing the [Backdrop Build](https://backdropbuild.com) program this year where we a proposing to turn our [REG](/team/reg.md) AI into a product. Joining efforts with us in this challenge is Israel Teixeira from [NAN systems](https://nan.systems/).

Our challenge is to make our AI agent [Reggie D. Bot](/team/reg.md) into a product that can be used by the general public. We are excited to be part of this program and we are looking forward to the results of this challenge. Reggie should be abole not only to query databases based on a users prompt and context but also interpret the results of the query, and provide a summary of the results in a way that is easy to understand by the user. As a Bonus we want also to make Reggie able to generate a full report, including analytical charts based on the query results.
