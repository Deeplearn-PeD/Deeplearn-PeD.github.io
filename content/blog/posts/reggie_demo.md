After a few months of hard work, we are pleased to announce that we have made the first release of Reggie D. Bot. The demo is available at [regdbot.deeplearn.ltd](https://regdbot.deeplearn.ltd). It is still an alpha release, So at this point you can't upload new datasets or register as an user. This release is for testing purposes only, and is linked with our project in the [Backdrop build v5](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v5/reggie-d-bot-yq9d) program.

Next steps before having a beta release, are to add the ability to upload new datasets, and to register as an user. We are also working on including function calling to the AI agent, so that it can also generate charts based on the query results.

Stay tuned for more updates on this project!
