We have just release a new version of Reggie D. Bot, v0.6.0. This release includes the following features:

- Improved user interface, with a new design and better user experience.
- Log of code snippets: Now every code snippet generated by Reggie D. Bot is saved in a log, so that you can easily access it later.
The log entry is stored alongside the question that motivated it and an explanation.
- Many bugfixes and performance improvements.

Enjoy the new features and let us know if you have any feedback!

This is still a prototype, but we already have a number of jobs lined up for Reggie! Stay tuned to hear about his journey.
