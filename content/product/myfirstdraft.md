Deeplearn has recently started a joint-venture with [Publicase](https://publicaseinternational.com/services/capacitacao-publicase), a company that specializes in helping sciecntists write better scientific articles. The goal of this joint-venture is to develop an AI model that can act as an interactive writing assitant for scientists. 

The AI model will be able to help scientists write better scientific articles by providing suggestions on how to improve their writing. The AI model will be trained on a large dataset of scientific articles, selected by the the author, and will be able to provide suggestions on grammar, style, and content. We are excited about this new project and we are looking forward to the results.

This product will be based on [Libby](/team/libby.md), our AI model that is able to generate, improve and review high quality text based on natural language prompts. We believe that Libby has the potential to be a great writing assistant for scientists, and we are excited to see how this project develops.
