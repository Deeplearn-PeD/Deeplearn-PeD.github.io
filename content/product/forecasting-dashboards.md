## Predict. Prepare. Protect.

**EpiForecast** is our flagship epidemic intelligence platform that transforms complex epidemiological data into actionable forecasts. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict disease trends days to weeks in advance, giving public health officials the critical time needed to prepare and respond.

### Key Capabilities

- **Epidemic Curve Prediction**: Machine learning models trained on historical outbreak data to forecast case trends
- **Resource Allocation Insights**: Predict hospitalization peaks to optimize bed capacity, staffing, and supplies
- **Multi-Pathogen Support**: Models for dengue, influenza, COVID-19, and other infectious diseases
- **Climate Integration**: Incorporates weather and climate data to improve prediction accuracy
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of forecasts with confidence intervals and scenario planning

### Why It Matters

Infectious disease forecasting has become essential for public health planning. With accurate predictions, health systems can:

- **Anticipate surges** and prepare hospitals before they become overwhelmed
- **Optimize interventions** by timing vector control and vaccination campaigns
- **Allocate resources** efficiently across regions based on predicted risk
- **Save lives** through early warning and proactive response

### Collaboration Highlight

Our forecasting technology powers predictions for the **[Mosqlimate project](https://mosqlimate.org/)**, delivering AI-enhanced disease forecasts that support public health decision-making in scenarios of global climate transformation.
