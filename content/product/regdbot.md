## Your AI-Powered Epidemiological Research Assistant

**EpiBot** (formerly Reggie D. Bot) is an intelligent AI agent designed specifically for epidemiological research. It allows public health professionals and researchers to query complex health databases using natural language—no SQL or programming required.

### What EpiBot Does

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions like *"Show me dengue cases in São Paulo by age group for 2023"* and get instant results
- **Multi-Database Access**: Connect to epidemiological surveillance systems, research databases, and public health registries
- **Intelligent Analysis**: EpiBot doesn't just retrieve data—it helps identify patterns, calculate rates, and suggest relevant visualizations
- **Research Acceleration**: Cut hours of data wrangling down to minutes, letting you focus on interpretation and action

### Designed for Public Health

EpiBot understands the specific needs of epidemiological work:

- **Incidence and prevalence calculations**
- **Age-standardized rates**
- **Time-series analysis for outbreak detection**
- **Geographic clustering identification**
- **Demographic breakdowns**
