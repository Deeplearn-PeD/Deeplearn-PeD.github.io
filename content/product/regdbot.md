Our database AI specialist [Reggie D. Bot](/team/reg.md) is now available for a demo at [regdbot.deeplearn.ltd](https://regdbot.deeplearn.ltd). This is an alpha release, so at this point you can't upload new datasets or register as an user. This release is for testing purposes only.

Feel free to have a chat with Reggie about the available demo datasets. In the upcoming  Beta version, you will be able to upload new datasets, and also connect to external data sources.

Stay tuned for more updates on this product!
