We are collaborating with the [Mosqlimate project](https://mosqlimate.org/), a research project dedicated to develop state-of-the-art predictive models for infectious diseases, within scenarios of global climate transformations in short medium and long term. Our team is helping with the scaling of the delivery infrasctructure for their analytical services, and their integration with the latest machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy AI tools, to boost overall user experience for researchers and public health officials.
