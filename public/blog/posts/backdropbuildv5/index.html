<p>We are now pleased to announce that we are confident to launch the Beta version of Reggie D. Bot. when the launch date for v5 comes.</p>
<p>In fact, Today we made the <a href="https://github.com/Deeplearn-PeD/reggui/releases/tag/v0.3.2">first release</a> of Reg D. Bot, for both desktop and Web, though we stil haven&rsquo;t made a public deploy on the web. Stay tuned as this will probably happen before the end of this month.</p>
