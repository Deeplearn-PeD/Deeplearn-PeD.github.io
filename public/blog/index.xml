      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people use AI to help them write documents particularly professional documents, but using standard online tools for writing is too cumbersome involving many copy/paste operations and tend to generate texts that are to generic and cannot be used directly before extensive manual editing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to help is this type of task, we have developed AIWrite, a very simple text generator using your choice of AI agent, that not only lets you properly and easily specify the structure of technical documents, but also makes it very easy to provide the AI information of your specific area of expertise, in the form of a collection of reference documents, so that the AI gent will write like a pro, not like a newbie!.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Demo of Reggie D. Bot is online</title>
      <link>https://deeplearn.ltd/blog/posts/reggie_demo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a few months of hard work, we are pleased to announce that we have made the first release of Reggie D. Bot. The demo is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://regdbot.deeplearn.ltd&#34;&gt;regdbot.deeplearn.ltd&lt;/a&gt;. It is still an alpha release, So at this point you can&amp;rsquo;t upload new datasets or register as an user. This release is for testing purposes only, and is linked with our project in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v5/reggie-d-bot-yq9d&#34;&gt;Backdrop build v5&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next steps before having a beta release, are to add the ability to upload new datasets, and to register as an user. We are also working on including function calling to the AI agent, so that it can also generate charts based on the query results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Continuing in Backdropbuild v5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous post we mentioned that we were joining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://backdropbuild.com&#34;&gt;Backdrop Build&lt;/a&gt; program this year where we are proposing to turn our &lt;a href=&#34;https://deeplearn.ltd/team/reg/&#34;&gt;REG&lt;/a&gt; AI into a product. Even with our best efforts we felt that the Reggie D. Bot was not ready to be a product yet. So we rejoined &lt;a href=&#34;https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v5/reggie-d-bot-yq9d&#34;&gt;Backdrop Build v5&lt;/a&gt; to continue our work on Reggie D. Bot, while benefitting of building withing the backdrop community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are now pleased to announce that we are confident to launch the Beta version of Reggie D. Bot. when the launch date for v5 comes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our journey has just begun in Backdrop Build v4! Israel and I are super excited and we are looking forward to having a first release very soon. Today I have managed to prepared the demos database that we are going to use for the first release. It has 20 years worth of dengue incidence data for Reggie to chew on!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another exciting milestone is that we&amp;rsquo;ll have the first usable interface for our product out for testing by the end of the week. We are looking forward to getting feedback from our users and making improvements based on their suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Draft</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deeplearn has recently started a joint-venture with &lt;a href=&#34;https://publicaseinternational.com/services/capacitacao-publicase&#34;&gt;Publicase&lt;/a&gt;, a company that specializes in helping sciecntists write better scientific articles. The goal of this joint-venture is to develop an AI model that can act as an interactive writing assitant for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI model will be able to help scientists write better scientific articles by providing suggestions on how to improve their writing. The AI model will be trained on a large dataset of scientific articles, selected by the the author, and will be able to provide suggestions on grammar, style, and content. We are excited about this new project and we are looking forward to the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Joining efforts with us in this challenge is Israel Teixeira from &lt;a href=&#34;https://nan.systems/&#34;&gt;NAN systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our challenge is to make our AI agent &lt;a href=&#34;https://deeplearn.ltd/team/reg/&#34;&gt;Reggie D. Bot&lt;/a&gt; into a product that can be used by the general public. We are excited to be part of this program and we are looking forward to the results of this challenge. Reggie should be abole not only to query databases based on a users prompt and context but also interpret the results of the query, and provide a summary of the results in a way that is easy to understand by the user. As a Bonus we want also to make Reggie able to generate a full report, including analytical charts based on the query results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2023 is upon us! In this new Year, DeepLearn starts as a new external face to a team os experienced researchers with many years of experience of bringing AI to verticals typically ignored by big AI corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along with the usual challenges related to simple survival, we are driven to find and develop new AI solutions than can solve problems instead of creating them (like the Fake news industry). In this road we hope to continue to meet inspiring people that can help us identify the worthy problems and the talented ones that will partner with us to build the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
