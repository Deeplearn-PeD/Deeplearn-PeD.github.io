          <p>Many people use AI to help them write documents particularly professional documents, but using standard online tools for writing is too cumbersome involving many copy/paste operations and tend to generate texts that are to generic and cannot be used directly before extensive manual editing.</p>
<p>In order to help is this type of task, we have developed AIWrite, a very simple text generator using your choice of AI agent, that not only lets you properly and easily specify the structure of technical documents, but also makes it very easy to provide the AI information of your specific area of expertise, in the form of a collection of reference documents, so that the AI gent will write like a pro, not like a newbie!.</p>
